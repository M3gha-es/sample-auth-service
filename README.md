# sample-auth-service

Greetings everyone!

In my journey of learning any topic, I create a sample project to demonstrate my learning. In this project, I have created a simple auth service to demonstrate my MERN stack understanding. 

A user can register to my site and view all of my paintings. Or, can view only a few of my paintings without loggin in. I have used the following concepts and tech stack for this project:
- Typescript, react and bootstrap for front-end
- Node and Mongo  for back-end APIs
- JWT for auth
- Yupp, Formik and such other for scehma/UI dev.

  As the paintings are my own, I prefer not sharing these assets to public. Further, I'm sharing access to only few files from my source code base. If you need to view more of my code samples, please email me.

  You can checkout the below video to see how the code works.

  Future plans:
  - Add like, share, and comment features.
  - Add bidding feature.
  - Add safe payment option.
